# Claude Code Instructions

## Workflow

- **Commit after each phase.** When a plan is divided into phases (e.g., Phase 1: Docs, Phase 2: Tooling), commit the relevant files at the end of each phase before moving to the next.
- **Update dev plan after each step.** Update [development-plan.md](/docs/development-plan.md) during the implementation
